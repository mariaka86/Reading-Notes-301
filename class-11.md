nosql vs sql

Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL	
- SQL databases are mainly called as Relational Databases (RDBMS);
- SQL databases are table based databases 
- SQL databases have a predefined schema
- SQL databases are vertically scalable( scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware.)
- SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data
 	 
 	 
 NoSQL	 
 - NoSQL database are mainly called as non-relational or distributed database.
 - NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores
 - NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
 - NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable(databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.)
 - NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language).

What does SQL stand for?

Structured Query Language

What is a relational database?

storing data through multiple tables and connecting them through a table.

What type of structure does a relational database work with?

a table

What is a ‘schema’?

basically a rule that tells SQL what type of data is allowed to be in the table.

What is a NoSQL database?

a database that relies on documents instead of tables
also nonrelational

How does it work?

What is inside of a Mongo database?

documents and keys

Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
 
NongoDB, because you can have multiple schemas in different documents. Or no schemas at all.

What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

you're not sure if the data adheres to your format and sometimes you can have duplicate data.
