What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

a component that can update based on user input and by setState().

we wait to store the users responses 

How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

by using a controlled component

Why would we use a ternary operator?
 so that code would be less messy.
Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}

x===y? true:false
